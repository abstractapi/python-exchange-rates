# AbstractAPI python-exchange-rates library

Integrate the powerful [Exchange Rates API from Abstract](https://www.abstractapi.com/exchange-rate-api) in your Python project in a few lines of code.

The Exchange Rate API is an REST API that allows you to:

- look up the latest exchange rates for 80+ currencies via the *live* endpoint
- get historical exchange rates using the *historical* endpoint
- convert an arbitrary amount from one currency to another using the *convert* endpoint

It's very simple to use: you only need to submit your API key and a currency symbol (such as "USD"), and the API will respond with current exchange rate, historical data, or convertion rates.
